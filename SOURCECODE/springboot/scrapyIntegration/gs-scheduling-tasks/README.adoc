This guide walks you through the steps for scheduling tasks with Spring.

== Base Taken From

https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-scheduling-tasks

== To use

go into complete directory, make sure that the paths are correct to the scraping files and sql info correct, then:
'./mvnw spring-boot:run'. 

You will see the springboot log call the java function every two minutes, and that is how we will call the scraping in our app

On my machine this ran robustly for 20 minutes called at two minute intervals.
