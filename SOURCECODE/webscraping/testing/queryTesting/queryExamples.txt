Here are some example Queries:

Generally we will build up the query from user input:
    -spell check each word from food.txt
    -create paramaterized springboot query

Then we can do queries as such using regular expressions/pattern matching:

>> select name from recipe where ingredients like '%flour%' and ingredients like '%salt%' and ingredients like '%pepper%';

>> select name from recipe where ingredients like '%ham%' and ingredients like '%cheese%' ;
